The EarWorm website is being developed by a small group of FEUP students, with a passion for both music and the preservation of its physical mediums, as a platform targeted at individual users that wish to buy physical musical products.

The main goal of the project is the development of a web-based and individually stylized music store for browsing and buying musical merchandise such as CDs, vinyls or other music affiliated products. After the initial deployment of the site, a team of administrators is required and will be responsible for managing the system and the stock, as well as ensuring any transaction runs smoothly.

This online platform grants users access to a vast library of purchaseable musical content, while also keeping track of their on-site transactions. Products are available for worldwide distribution, providing a myriad of payment options. Curated recommendations will be provided to each user based on their listening preferences.

Users are separated into groups with different permissions. These groups include the site administrators, with complete access and modification privileges, and the registered users, with privileges to enter information, buy and cancel ordered items, browse and inspect the site's products and rate previously obtained items.

The platform will have a responsive design, allowing users to have a pleasant browsing experience not only visually but functionally as well, regardless of the device (desktop, tablet or smartphone).
